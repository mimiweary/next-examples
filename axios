//First, make sure your WordPress site has the REST API enabled. You can do this by installing the WordPress REST API plugin.
//Next, you'll need to send a PUT request to the WordPress REST API endpoint for the specific post you want to update. 
//You can use the Axios library to make the request, like this:


import axios from 'axios';

const updatePost = async (postId, updatedData) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.put(`https://your-wordpress-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/${postId}`, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      data: updatedData
    });

    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};


//In the above code, postId is the ID of the post you want to update, and updatedData is an object that contains the updated data for the post. 
//The headers property sets the content type of the request to application/json.
//Finally, you can call the updatePost function and pass in the post ID and updated data, like this:

const updatedData = {
  title: 'Updated Post Title',
  content: 'Updated post content',
};

updatePost(123, updatedData).then(post => {
  console.log(post);
});

//In this example, the updatePost function sends a PUT request to the WordPress REST API endpoint for the post with ID 123, 
//and updates the post with the provided updatedData. 
//The updated post data is returned as a response from the API and can be used in your Next.js application as needed.
